# Ansible: Visualization

> This repo explains how to visualize your Ansible playbook.  
>
> Graphviz will draw an SVG picture for you by reading a .dot file ansible-playbook-grapher will create by examining your playbook.  
>
> If you want to build your own map manually, it's worth using the [VSCode MarkMap](https://markmap.js.org/) plugin.

## Usage  
Run this command to visualize your playbook:
```shell
ansible-playbook-grapher -i your-inventory-file --include-role-tasks your-playbook.yml
```
